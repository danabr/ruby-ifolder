A tool for interacting with ifolder, without having to install mono and
installing from source.

The tool interacts with the ifolder web service, which essentialy makes it a
hack.

How to use:
$ ifolder

First time you run the application you will be asked to specify the URL to the
ifolder server.

List all ifolders
$ ifolder ls

Browse an ifolder
$ ifolder ls path

Download a file
$ ifolder download path

Downloaded files are placed in ~/ifolder, and with the same subpath as in
the ifolder itself. Once a file has been downloaded, it is considered tracked.
That means that it will be automatically synced when you run:
$ ifolder synch

The synchronization tool will tell you about any errors (such as conflicts).
