A tool for interacting with ifolder, without having to install mono and
installing from source.

The tool interacts with the ifolder web service.

NOTE: This is a work in progress and should not be used for anything serious.
      For example, credentials are stored in plain text to ease development
      and testing.

How to use:
$ ifolder

First time you run the application you will be asked to specify the ip or domain
name of the ifolder server.

List all ifolders
$ ifolder ls

Download an ifolder
$ ifolder download name

Downloaded files are placed in ~/ifolder, and with the same subpath as in
the ifolder itself.
